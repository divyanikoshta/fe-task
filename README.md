This repo includes solutions of coding exercises for preliminary Frontend engineer evaluation.

## Frontend Work Experience
- Designed and implemented high-performance web applications using React and Angular, optimizing rendering speed, load times, and memory usage.
- Leveraged server-side rendering (SSR) and hydration techniques to improve SEO and reduce initial load times for web applications.
- Applied advanced bundle optimization strategies, including lazy loading, code splitting, and tree shaking, to reduce JS payload size and improve Core Web Vitals.
- Utilized React Profiler, React.memo, and virtualized lists to optimize frontend performance, focusing on minimizing re-renders and ensuring smooth user experiences.
